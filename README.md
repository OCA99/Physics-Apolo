# Project Apollo

## Description

We are 3 second year students from CITM University in Barcelona. We have been asked to develop a space game emulating the Apollo Mision: To launch a spaceship from earth, land safely on the moon and also return to the earth safely.

We used SDL libraries to achieve this.
